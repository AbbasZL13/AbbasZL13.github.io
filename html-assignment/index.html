    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="images/AbbasZl.png" alt="Photo of me">
    <p>Hi my name is Abbas and I'm 17 years old and currently studying at Algonquin College in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program. I enjoy learning about different subjects and discovering how they connect to real life. I love baking new recipes, especially sweets, and sharing them on social media. I also love listening to <em>Taylor Swift a lot</em> because her music inspires me to stay motivated and she is my <strong>favorite thing</strong> on earth. 
</p>
    <p>I would say Iâ€™m a very introverted and quiet person most of the time. I like being on my own and I enjoy being independent, I don't like working with partners unless they are my friends. I like setting little goals for myself and working toward them at my own pace. My dream is to open my own bakery, so I want to continue learning, gain experience, and grow into a career that combines creativity, cakes, and ovens with technology.

    <p>"The worst kind of person is someone who makes someone feel bad, dumb or stupid for â€¦ being excited about something. I don't think you should ever have to apologise for your excitement just because something's cliche doesn't mean it's not something that's awesome"</p>
